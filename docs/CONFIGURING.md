# Configuring Supermarket 

## Development

The goal of this document is to explain how to setup and configure Supermarket
locally for development. As the application grows in complexity, the amount of
configuration grows as well.

1. The first step is to copy the `.env.example` in the project root to `.env`.
   Supermarket uses [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to handle setting
   environment variables.
1. From here you will want to create and configure the different services
   required to run Supermarket.

  * `GITHUB_KEY` and `GITHUB_SECRET` are generated by registering an application
    on GitHub. A GitHub application is required so that users can link their
    GitHub accounts to their Supermarket account.
  * The `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY` is used by Devise for security purposes. When
    developing locally, feel free to set it to anything.
  * The `SECRET_KEY_BASE` is similar to the `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY`, but is for
    Rails. Set it to whatever you want in development.
