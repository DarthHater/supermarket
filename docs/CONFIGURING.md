# Configuring Supermarket

Supermarket uses [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to handle setting
environment variables. These are the different configurations needed to get
Supermarket running.

* `GITHUB_KEY` and `GITHUB_SECRET` are generated by registering an application
  on GitHub. A GitHub application is required so that users can link their
  GitHub accounts to their Supermarket account.
* `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` is used for interacting with the GitHub API.
  Supermarket uses the GitHub API for CLA signature verification checking.
  Generate a personal access token within Account Settings > Applications >
  Personal Access Tokens. **This must be set to run Supermarket locally.**
* The `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY` is used by Devise for security purposes. When
  developing locally, feel free to set it to anything.
* The `SECRET_KEY_BASE` is similar to the `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY`, but is for
  Rails. Set it to whatever you want in development.
* `CLA_SIGNATURE_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` is the email that gets notified when CLAs
  are signed.
* `SENTRY_URL` is the URL for logging for the error logger
  [Sentry](https://getsentry.com/). In development, it is okay not to set it.
* `PUBSUBHUBBUB_SECRET` is used for Supermarket to subscripe to repositories.
  It can be set to anything in development.
* `CHEF_OAUTH2_APP_ID` and `CHEF_OAUTH2_SECRET` are generated when registering
  an application on oc-id: https://id.opscode.com/id/oauth/applications/ They
  are needed for authentication via OAuth2. When using the application locally,
  be sure to create an application and set the callback url to
  `http://localhost:3000/auth/chef_oauth2/callback` or whatever localhost domain
  you use.
* `CHEF_OAUTH2_SITE` is currently not used for anything within the application,
  but if you wanted to provide a provider for authentication, you could set this
  and configure it in the OmniAuth initializer. It configued by default in the
  [omniauth-chef-oauth2 gem](https://github.com/opscode/omniauth-chef-oauth2).
