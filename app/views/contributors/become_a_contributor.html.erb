    <h1>Become a Contributor</h1>

    <p>In order to contribute to Chef Software, Inc.'s open source projects, you must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The CLA comes in two different varieties - one for individuals (ICLA) and one for corporations (CCLA). The purpose of the ICLA and CCLA is to makes everyone's rights clear. You can read more about the CLA in the <a href="https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-license-agreement-cla" target="_blank">opscode/chef CONTRIBUTING.md</a> document.</p>

    <p>Before signing a CLA, <%= link_to "you must link your GitHub account", link_github_profile_path %> to your Supermarket account. Supermarket uses GitHub's API to check the CLA signature status of committers in a pull request. If there are any committers in a pull request that have not signed a CLA, the supermarket-chef GitHub user will automatically comment on the pull request, letting the users know they need to sign a CLA. If all users are verified, it will add a "Signed CLA" label to the issue.</p>

    <p>If you want to sign the ICLA, <%= link_to "you complete the form online", new_icla_signature_path %> now. If you want to sign the CCLA on behalf of your company, first <%= link_to "check to see if your company has already completed a CCLA", ccla_signatures_path %>. If they have, ask an admin of the company to invite you to join the CCLA. If your company has not signed the CCLA and you are authorized to do so, <%= link_to "create a new CCLA signature for your company", new_ccla_signature_path %>. Once you sign the CCLA, you will be able to invite other co-workers to join the CCLA on behalf of your company.</p>

    <p>You can view a list of <%= link_to "all of the contributors", contributors_path %> and <%= link_to "the companies with completed CCLAs", ccla_signatures_path %>. You can also view printable versions of the <%= link_to "ICLA", agreement_icla_signatures_path %> and <%= link_to "CCLA", agreement_ccla_signatures_path %>.</p>
